<h1>How to use</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
The following must be installed:<br />
 <ul>
   <li>Eclipse 3.7 and CDT 8.0 or newer</li>
   <li>Pkg-config utility</li>
   <li>Mingw/Cygwin (Windows only)</li>
   <li>Libraries you are planning to use with pkg-config (such as GTK+ or gtkmm)</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Property page</h2>
<h3>Accessing the property page</h3>
You can access the Pkg-config property tab by selecting a project in the workspace
and alternatively either click Project -> Properties in the menubar or simply
right click the project and choose Properties. From the property page navigate
C/C++ Build -> Setting -> Pkg-config tab.
<h3>Functionality of the property page</h3>
The property page lists all packages that were found by pkg-config utility. By
checking a package or multiple of them the compiler and linker flags are
automatically set to the active build configuration. Unchecking of packages
will remove those flags from the build configuration that are not needed by
other checked packages. Pressing the OK button closes the property page and
starts rebuilding the index.
<h2>Preference page</h2>
<p>It is possible to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment
variables from the Pkg-config preference page. The page can be accessed by
clicking Window -> Preferences -> Pkg-config in the menubar.
Note that PKG_CONFIG_PATH can be left blank if pkg-config is found in PATH
environment variable.</p>
PKG_CONFIG_PATH is a list of directories to search for .pc files.<br />
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR replaces the default pkg-config search directory. 
<h2>Building program code</h2>
After the packages that the code depends on are checked on the property
page everything is set. Rebuilding the index may take some time depending on
the size of your codebase. When you see zero unresolved inclusions you are
ready to build the program code whenever you want.
